// Arrays!

// As with Objects, we're trying to get you enough repetition to the point where this is instinctive. If any of it starts to feel repetitive, that's awesome! To facilitate this, keep writing new code for each exercise; don't copy and paste previous code. Practicing these keystrokes is super valuable.

// Arrays are great places to store lists of similar information.
// Where objects have property names to denote the different slots you can store data in, arrays have numbered indices.
